## Hobbies
Outside of CS/ECE/Math, I enjoy reading, cooking, playing soccer, exploring nature, traveling, investing, trying out colognes, and playing games with my younger brother. Check out the gallery below

## Current
I'm currently on the 3rd book of the "Before the Coffee Gets Cold" series by Toshikazu Kawaguchi, called "Before Your Memory Fades."

I'm also watching "Better Call Saul", "Beyblade Metal Masters", and playing "Overcooked: All You Can Eat" with my siblings.

I also just got leather gloves (they don't fit very well, but they look nice) and want to get a trenchcoat!

My current colognes are Stronger With You: Intensly, Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue, & Calvin Klein Eternity.
